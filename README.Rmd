# ssoestimate

A shared Service Organsition, SSO, is an administrative entity that
carries out financial transaction on behalf of a number of client organisations.
The kind of transactions done by the SSO are the same for all clients.

The goal of ssoestimate is to estimate the monetary error rate of transactions for each 
single client of the SSO. This is done by using a sample from all the transactions
of the SSO as a proxy. This assumes that the most efficient way to estimate 
this error rate is by means of sampling: it is not feasable to do
for example an integral data-analyses of the transactions.
The one big assumption that ssoestimate uses is that the set of transactions from the
client is a random sample from all the transactions carried out by the SSO.

Using this assumption makes it possible to efficiently estimate the error rate
for all the clients of the SSO. For example suppose that the SSO processed 100,000 transactions, for 10 clients.
And suppose we want to establish with 95% confidence that the error rate for each client
is at most 1%, then we could use (expecting no errors in the samples) a sample of 300 transactions from each client,
totalling 3000 samples. Instead when using ssoestimate it suffices
to draw only 350 transactions in total to conclude with 95% confidence that the error
rate of eahc client is at most 1%.

A small paper about the algorithm used is forthcoming.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ssoestimate like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ssoestimate)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
