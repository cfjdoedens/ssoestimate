Description: Estimate maximum error rate of service provided to any client
    of a Shared Service Organization (SSO) by using a sufficiently large,
    but relatively small, sample of the overall population. The key assumption
    for this is that the service for each client can be considered as a
    random sample from the service of the overall population.
